Restful API Project Submission
Project Overview

This project focused on developing a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API was designed to fetch and display user data stored in a JSON file, providing multiple endpoints for retrieving and filtering the data.

The primary goal of the project was to build a fully functional RESTful API, which involved integrating the fs module to interact with JSON files and implementing error handling to manage invalid requests. Through this, I aimed to enhance my understanding of backend development and API design.
What I Learned

Working on this project taught me several key skills. I learned how to set up a Node.js project with Express and create RESTful API endpoints. Additionally, I became proficient in using the fs module to read and manipulate JSON data. Testing the endpoints with tools like Postman gave me valuable insights into verifying the functionality of APIs and debugging issues.
API Features

The API provided the following functionalities:

1) Listing all users through the /users endpoint.
2) Retrieving user information by ID using /users/:id.
3) Filtering users based on their profession via /users/profession/:profession.
4) Fetching users by name through /users/name/:name.
5) Handling errors for invalid user IDs, professions, and names to ensure robust     	functionality.

Reflection

This project was an excellent introduction to building RESTful APIs. It gave me practical experience with essential tools like Express and the fs module, while reinforcing concepts such as routing, error handling, and data manipulation. The process of testing endpoints with Postman allowed me to confirm that the API behaved as expected and provided reliable results.
Challenges

The most significant challenge I faced during the project was implementing effective error handling. Ensuring that the API responded correctly to invalid requests required careful planning and testing, but overcoming this challenge was a rewarding experience.
